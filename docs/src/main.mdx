# Untangled: Language Reference Manual

**Untangled** is a new programming language with first-class support for multithreading. It
encourages users to write highly parallelized programs by providing safe and easy-to-use primitives
and abstractions over multithreading.

  ```untangled
  thread_def SumWorker {
    receive { int x -> int target = x; _ -> exit(); }
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < target; i++) sum += i;
    parent << sum; // send the result back
  }

  thread_def Main {
    thread my_worker = spawn SumWorker;
    my_worker << 100000;
    // Free to do something else here...
    receive { int x -> int result = x; _ -> exit(); };
    print(result);
  }
  ```

    continues to run while the `SumWorker` thread does hard, CPU-bound computations.
