# Untangled: Project Plan

### Planning process

We planned our tasks and timeline around the the class’s assignment deadlines throughout the
semester.

We tracked incomplete tasks using markdown to-do lists checked in to our codebase.

Throughout the project, in order to identify areas we needed to work on, we attempted to run
programs from our original proposal (and other example programs, e.g. from the draft of the Language
Reference Manual). Observing what functionality was missing or broken showed us what we still needed
to work on!


### Implementation timeline

- Feb 13: **First commit**
- Feb 21: **Scanner/Parser/AST implemented**
- Feb 28: **Language Reference Manual draft finished**
- Mar 26: **First “hello world” program runs**
- April 10: **First Untangled thread spawned**
- April 11: **Basic control flow (if, while, etc.)**
- April 18: **First message passing between threads**
- April 27: **Arrays and tuples initial implementation**
- May 2: **Semaphores**
- May 3: **String escape sequences**
- May 5: **Docs completed**
- May 5: **Final commit**


### Team member responsibilities & contributions

Each team member contributed to all parts of the project; we didn’t delineate specific roles. Key
contributions to call out are as follows:

**Nick**
- Major contributions to code generation
- Significant contributions to every phase of compiler implementation (scanner, parser, AST,
  semantic checking)
- Authored first draft of test script
- Led development of multithreading features
  - Semaphores
  - Message passing
  - Thread spawning
- Contributed to build system (makefiles, compiler CLI, etc.)

**Caleb**
- Major contributions to code generation
- Significant contributions to every phase of compiler implementation (scanner, parser, AST,
  semantic checking)
- Led development for arrays
- Led development for tuples
- Contributions to test script

**Luke**
- Significant contributions to every phase of compiler implementation (scanner, parser, AST,
  code generation)
- Built docs system (visual design, front-end implementation, PDF build script)
- Major contributor to docs content (language reference manual, tutorial, etc.)
- Authored test script
- Wrote `.tmlanguage` grammar (and VS Code extension) for Untangled language syntax highlighting
- Contributed to build system (makefiles, compiler CLI, etc.)

**Duru**
- Major contributor to docs content (tutorial, language reference manual)
- Major contributions to code generation
- Significant contributions to every phase of compiler implementation (scanner, parser, AST,
  semantic checking)

**Chloe**
- Contributions to scanner and parser
- Contributions to language reference manual


### Tools, languages, and technologies
- The compiler is written in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)
  - We use `ocamllex` to generate the scanner
  - We use `ocamlyacc` to generate the parser
  - We use the [official OCaml LLVM bindings](https://llvm.moe/) to generate LLVM IR
  - We use [Dune](https://dune.build/) as our build system
  - We use the `clang` compiler to generate executables from LLVM IR
- The syntax highlighter is implemented using a
  [TextMate grammar](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars), which is the standard
  used by VS Code and other editors.
- The docs are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (a markdown dialect that supports
  [React](https://reactjs.org/) components).
  - For development and production builds of the docs website, we use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
  - Syntax highlighting in the docs comes from [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/), which adapts VS
    Code’s syntax highlighting engine to run in the browser.
  - The docs PDF is generated using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), a headless controller for the
    Chrome browser.
- We pair-programmed during our work sessions using Microsoft’s VS Code
  [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
  extension.
- We used [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control and for asynchronous collaboration.
