# Untangled: Lessons Learned

**Nick**

I learned how to work effectively as a team. At the beginning of the semester, it was challenging to
communicate with other members, because of the complexity of our language. I learned how to clearly
express my though process throughout the semester, which also made work sessions much more
productive.

Another important takeaway for me was to be proactive and take initiative working on features. I
felt time pressure towards the end of the semester to finish the code generation. I think we started
work on some big features relatively late, because we were unsure about how to navigate the LLVM
API. Therefore, my suggestion for future groups is to take a stab at the code generation earlier in
the semester, and take advantage of all the available resources (asking on Stack Overflow,
discussing problems with one’s project advisor, etc.).

- Learning about the limitations of what can/can’t be done in compile time versus runtime has been
  the biggest takeaway from this project.
- Learning to make commits that are meaningful and not disrupt progress for other members.
- Discussing pros and cons of complex architectural design choices.
