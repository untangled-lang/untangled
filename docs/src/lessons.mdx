# Untangled: Lessons Learned

**Nick**

I learned how to work effectively as a team. At the beginning of the semester, it was challenging to
communicate with other members, because of the complexity of our language. I learned how to clearly
express my though process throughout the semester, which also made work sessions much more
productive.

Another important takeaway for me was to be proactive and take initiative working on features. I
felt time pressure towards the end of the semester to finish the code generation. I think we started
work on some big features relatively late, because we were unsure about how to navigate the LLVM
API. Therefore, my suggestion for future groups is to take a stab at the code generation earlier in
the semester, and take advantage of all the available resources (asking on Stack Overflow,
discussing problems with one’s project advisor, etc.).

- Learning about the limitations of what can/can’t be done in compile time versus runtime has been
  the biggest takeaway from this project.
- Learning to make commits that are meaningful and not disrupt progress for other members.
- Discussing pros and cons of complex architectural design choices.

I learned a lot about collaboration and communication skills while working on this project. Our
day-to-day project involved discussing very abstract ideas at an incredible level of detail, and
often required a lot of domain-specific knowledge. As a result, when I had disagreements with other
team members about the best way to design or implement any piece of our language, I often ran into
a situation where *neither* of us was doing a good job of articulating our ideas to the other.
Patiently breaking down complex concepts step-by-step in order to discuss them thoroghly was a skill
I developed a lot.

I also learned lessons about balancing timing and complexity. There were a few problems I worked on
over the course of this project that I sunk a huge number of hours into, but was never able to
solve. Knowing when to quit or try a different approach is a skill I’m still working on, but it’s
important to avoid letting the “sunk cost” fallacy drag you down—to know when to cut your losses
and move on to something else.

I’d advise future groups to start early, plan carefully, and be willing to compromise. These were
skills we all worked on and struggled with over the course of the project, but had to learn in order
to be successful.

- I feel that I have learned how to effectively communicate with my teammates. Especially because we were
such a big group, it was hard for us to work at the same time. By learning how to effectively communicate
work we have already accompished, overall structural changes we may have made and architectural plans we
came up with; we could still keep up with the contents of the project
- I also learned how to trust my teammates. I can't always fully trust that other people will do thorough
work and feel the need to either go over everything in my own time or get involved with every aspect of the
project. But I feel that with this group I did not have this issue. This is also a testament to how reliable
and hard-working everyone has been through the process.
- Technically speaking, I got to learn how compilers generate code which was extremely cool!

I have two pieces of advice to the future groups:
1. Work in teams! It might be hard to work as a full group every single work session but try to at least
work in groups of two. Having other people to bounce ideas off are extremely valuable and lead to much better
code generation even if it's a little slower.
2. This might be more of a personal preference, but try to be involved with every stage of the compiler.
You get to learn a lot of cool things and features you wouldn't learn if you kept to only specifc portions.
