# Untangled: Testing

### Methodology

We created a suite of tests of each stage of our compiler process:
- **Abstract Syntax Tree** tests: check that the scanner and parser successfully produce the AST
  representation that we expect for a broad range of Untangled programs.

  These tests compare a pretty-printed AST output from the compiler against pregenerated “ground
  truth” ASTs.

- **Semantic “sast”** tests: extend AST tests to *also* check the types assigned (by the semantic
  analyzer) to each node in the AST.

  These tests compare a pretty-printed *semantically-checked* AST output from the compiler against
  pregenerated “ground truth” ASTs.

- **End-to-end** tests: checks that a broad range of Untangled programs will compile correctly and
  produce the final stdout that we expect.

  These tests compile, link, and execute Untangled programs, capturing their output and comparing
  it against pregenerated “ground truth” output.

We created a Python script that automatically runs and checks the output of all of our tests.
- The script also supports nested structures for the tests, to allow organizing tests arbitrarily
  within each compiler step.
- The script supports “filtering” tests to run only a subset of tests at a time.
