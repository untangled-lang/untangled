## Interesting language features

### Runtime value “type tags”

In Untangled, every type has a corresponding integer “tag” value. Each Untangled type has a
corresponding tag, as follows:

- `int` 0
- `float` 1
- `string` 2
- `bool` 3
- `tuple` 4
- `array` 5
- `thread` 6
- `semaphore` 7

In the case of tuples and arrays, tags have a more complicated “nested” structure, which we will
discuss below.



### Arrays

*Implemented by Duru, Luke, Nick, and Caleb*

Arrays in Untangled have static size and the llvm representation is a struct pointer as follows:

<div style={{ marginTop: '3rem', marginBottom: "4rem"}}>
  <ArrayStructure />
</div>

The `data_array` is a void pointer to a heap array containing the values. `size` indicates the
number of elements inside the `data_array`. `tags` is a pointer which points to a heap array containing
the tag values for the array. `tags_size` is an integer value holding the length of the `tags`.
{/* int[6] foo = [4, 5, 6, 2, 1, 12]; */}

The `tags` array always stores 5 as the first element to indicate that it's an array, and the
next element indicates the size of `data_array`. The remaining tag values correspond to the tags
of the array's element type.

Here is an example of how `int[6] foo = [4, 5, 6, 2, 1, 12];` is represented.

  <ArrayEx />
</div>



### Semaphores

*Implemented by Duru and Nick*

The llvm representation for a semaphore is a struct pointer as follows:

<div style={{ marginTop: '3rem', marginBottom: "4rem"}}>
  <SemaphoreStructure />
</div>

`mutex` is pointer to a C opaque mutex. The `mutex` is used whenever a thread reads or writes to
`count`.

For a `--` operation on a semaphore, the program checks if `count` is positive. If
the `count` is positive, it decrements the `count` value and allows the thread to continue executing.
If the `count` is 0, the program jumps to a waiting state and continuously checks whether the
`count` is positive.

For a `++` operation on a semaphore, the program increments the `count` value.



### Tuples

*Implemented by Duru, Nick, and Caleb*.

The llvm representation of a tuple struct is as follows:

<div style={{ marginTop: '3rem', marginBottom: "4rem"}}>
  <TupleStructure />
</div>

The llvm representation of a tuple is the same as a message to simplify the process of message passing.
In a tuple, `head` and `tail` points to other `data_t` structs, corresponding to the first and second
element of the tuple, respectively. This structure grows recursively if the first or second element
is another tuple.

Here is an example of how `((bool, int), string) bar = ((true, 1), "hello");` is represented.

<div style={{ marginTop: '3rem', marginBottom: "4rem"}}>
  <TupleEx />
</div>



### Threads

#### Overview

The llvm representation of a `thread_def` follows the signature of a routine
from `pthread.h` in C, which is a function that accepts a `void *` argument and
returns a `void *` value.

In Untangled, every instance of `thread_def` implicitly accepts a struct pointer
which contains the `parent_queue` and the `child_queue` and returns a null
pointer. The `parent_queue` is a pointer to the message queue of the procedure
that calls the current thread; the `child_queue` is a pointer to the message
queue generated for the current thread.

Every time a new thread is spawned, the current thread initializes a new struct pointer. The
`parent_queue` of the struct points to the current's thread `child_queue` and the `child_queue`
points to a newly generated queue. The child thread is executed by using the `pthread_create` routine
from C. The `spawn` keyword returns a reference to the new queue struct.

The initial execution of `thread_def Main` behaves differently compared to other spawned threads.
At compilation time, the program generates a `main` function as the entry point for the llvm code
and initializes a struct pointer as argument to `thread_def Main`. The `parent_queue` and `child_queue`
of the struct points to the same queue generated in `main`. The Untangled program is executed when
`main` calls `thread_def Main`.


#### Thread Joining

Untangled programs implicitly wait for all threads to finish executing before exiting.

The program allocates a global counter to indicate the number of running
threads, which starts at 1, and a global mutex. The global mutex is used to lock write
operations on the global counter. Every time a new thread is spawned, the
current thread increments the global counter by 1. When a thread finishes
executing, it decrements the global counter by 1. The `main` function returns
when the global counter equals to 0, which indicates that all running threads,
including the initial `thread_def Main` instance, have finished executing.


#### Message queue

*Implemented by Nick*

The message queue is a dynamic data structure written in llvm to support message
passing between threads. In llvm, the queue is represented as a struct which contains its
size, capacity, a pointer to an array of messages, and a mutex.

When a thread sends a message, the program pushes the message onto the queue. If the queue is full,
the program resizes the queue by doubling the capacity of the array. The
compiler pops a message from the queue in a receive statement if the queue is not empty.

The program uses the mutex stored within each queue to prevent data race on queue operations.


#### Message passing

*Implemented by Duru, Luke, Nick, and Caleb.*

When a thread sends a message, the value is stored in a `data_t` struct, with the exception of a
tuple type, which is already represented as a reference to `data_t`.

<div style={{ marginTop: '3rem', marginBottom: "4rem"}}>
  <DataTStructure />
</div>

The `tag` field a `data_t` struct stores the value's corresponding tag number. For all data
types, except tuple, the `head` points to the message value and the `tail` is a null pointer.
After the `data_t` has been constructed, the reference to `data_t` is pushed onto the queue of
the receiving thread.


#### Generating tags

*Implemented by Duru, Luke, Nick, and Caleb.*

During compilation time, an array of tag values are constructed for each pattern
in the receive block. The tags are generated through a recursive analysis of the pattern types.

Here is an example of what that would look like:

<div style={{ marginTop: '3rem', marginBottom: "4rem"}}>
  <PatternMatching />
</div>


#### Pattern matching

*Implemented by Duru, Luke, Nick, and Caleb.*

When a message is received, the program iterates through the array of tag values to find a matching
tag. Once a tag has been matched, the program switches on the index of the matched
tag values in the array to jump to the corresponding statement.

In a switch statement, the `wild card` pattern has a tag value of -1, which can match any tag
value.
