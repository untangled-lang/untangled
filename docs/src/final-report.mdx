## Introduction

Most modern processors have multiple CPU cores that can perform concurrent computations;
parallelizing work across these cores can yield major performance gains. However, many modern
programming languages still emphasize single-threaded programming—where they do allow
multithreading, it is seldom ergonomic.

**Untangled** is a new programming language with first-class support for multithreading. It
encourages users to write highly parallelized programs by providing safe and easy-to-use primitives
and abstractions over multithreading.

Untangled is very useful for writing any kind of program that performs any CPU-heavy work that
doesn’t need to run strictly sequentially.
